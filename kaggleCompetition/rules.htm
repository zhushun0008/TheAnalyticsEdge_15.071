<p>Submissions may not use or incorporate information from hand labeling or human prediction of the validation dataset or test data records.</p>
<p>If the Competition is a multi-stage Competition with temporally separate training data and/or leaderboard data, one or more valid Submissions must be made and selected during each stage of the Competition in the manner described on the Competition Website.</p>
<h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
<h4>DATA</h4>
<p>'Data' means the Data or Datasets linked from the Competition Website for the purpose of use by Participants in the Competition. For the avoidance of doubt, Data is deemed for the purpose of these Competition Rules to include any prototype or executable code provided to Participants by Kaggle or Competition Sponsor via the Website. Participants must use the Data only as permitted by these Competition Rules and any associated data use rules specified on the Competition Website.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise permitted by the terms of the Competition Website, Participants must use the Data solely for the purpose and duration of the Competition, including but not limited to reading and learning from the Data, analyzing the Data, modifying the Data and generally preparing your Submission and any underlying models and participating in forum discussions on the Website. Participants agree to use suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Competition Rules from gaining access to the Data and agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Data to any party not participating in the Competition. Participants agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission or unauthorized access of the Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission. Participants agree that participation in the Competition shall not be construed as having or being granted a license (expressly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise) under, or any right of ownership in, any of the Data.</p>
<h4>EXTERNAL DATA</h4>
<p>Unless otherwise expressly stated on the Competition Website, Participants must not use data other than the Data to develop and test their models and Submissions. Competition Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any Participant who Competition Sponsor discovers has undertaken or attempted to undertake the use of data other than the Data, or who uses the Data other than as permitted according to the Competition Website and in these Competition Rules, in the course of the Competition.</p>
<h4>CODE SHARING</h4>
<p>Participants are prohibited from privately sharing source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Data, and any such sharing is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification.</p>
<p>Participants are permitted to publicly share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Data, or otherwise relevant to the Competition, provided that such sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. By so sharing, the sharing Participant is thereby deemed to have licensed the shared code under the MIT License (an open source software license commonly described at &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;).</p>
<h4>OPEN-SOURCE CODE</h4>
<p>A Submission will be ineligible to win a prize if it was developed using code containing or depending on software licensed under an open source license:</p>
<p>* other than an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see &lt;http://opensource.org/&gt;); or<br />* an open source license that prohibits commercial use.</p>
<h3>WINNING</h3>
<h4>DETERMINING WINNERS</h4>
<p>This Competition is a challenge of skill and the final results are determined solely by leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard (subject to compliance with these Competition Rules). Participants' scores and ranks on the Competition Website at any given stage of the Competition will be based on the evaluation metric described on the Competition Website, as determined by applying the predictions in the Submission to the ground truth of a validation dataset whose instances were a fixed set sampled from the Data.</p>
<p>The evaluation metric used for scoring and ranking Submissions will be displayed on the Competition Website.</p>
<p>Prize awards are subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Competition Rules. All decisions of the Competition Sponsor and judges will be final and binding on all matters relating to this Competition. Competition Sponsor reserves the right to examine the Submission and any associated code or documentation for compliance with these Competition Rules. In the event that the Submission demonstrates a breach of these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions:</p>
<p>* disqualify your Submission(s); or <br />* require that you remediate within one week all issues identified in your Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).</p>
<h4>RESOLVING TIES</h4>
<p>A tie between two or more valid and identically ranked submissions will be resolved in favour of the tied submission that was submitted first.</p>
<h4>DECLINING PRIZES</h4>
<p>A Participant may decline to be nominated as a Winner by notifying Kaggle directly within one week following the Competition deadline, in which case the declining Participant forgoes any prize or other features associated with winning the Competition. Kaggle reserves the right to disqualify a Participant who so declines at Kaggle's sole discretion if Kaggle deems disqualification appropriate.</p>
<h3>WINNERS' OBLIGATIONS</h3>
<h4>DELIVERY &amp; DOCUMENTATION</h4>
<p>As a condition of receipt of the Prize, the Prize winner must deliver the final model’s software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation (consistent with the winning model documentation template available on the kaggle wiki at https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/WinningModelDocumentationTemplate) to the Competition Sponsor. The delivered software code must be capable of generating the winning Submission and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully.</p>
<p>If a potential winning Participant or Team member is a U.S. citizen, potential winner must also sign and return an IRS W-9 form, or if a foreign resident, an IRS W-8BEN form, within the stated time in order to claim the prize.</p>
<p>Potential winners will be disqualified and the prize may be awarded to an alternate winner (the next-ranked qualified Participant on the leaderboard) if</p>
<p>* the required documentation is not returned within 14 days after receipt of any request to provide documentation;<br />* prize notification letter/email or prize is returned as undeliverable; or<br />* potential winner or winning Team member is disqualified for any reason.</p>

<h4>PARTICIPANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING</h4>
<p>As a further condition of receipt of a Prize, each winning Participant thereby licenses their winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission according to the Winner License Type specified above (note: if no Winner License Type is specified above, the Winner License Type is deemed to be Non-Exclusive License).</p>
<h5>PUBLIC COMPETITIONS: NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE</h5>

<h5>RESEARCH COMPETITIONS: OPEN SOURCE LICENSE</h5>
<p>If the Winner License Type for the Competition (see Winner License Type above) is Open Source License, then each Winner by accepting a Prize thereby:</p>
<p>* licenses their winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under the MIT License (an open source software license commonly described at &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;); and<br />* represents that he/she/it has the unrestricted right to grant that license.</p>
<h5>RECRUITING COMPETITION SUBMISSION LICENSE GRANT</h5>
<p>If the Competition is classed above as a Recruiting Competition, Participant agrees to grant and hereby grants to Competition Sponsor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicenseable right to use, review, reproduce, and internally distribute the Submission (including any and all submitted source code) in connection with evaluating Participant's suitability for employment, provided that the Submission licensed as set forth above will not be used for Competition Host’s commercial purposes except as may otherwise be set forth in this Agreement.</p>
